# Moor Model FSM using VHDL

problem: Using enumerated data type; write the VHDL code of a Moor model finite state machine to recognize when a serial stream of bits has the pattern "00111".
This machine has three (3) inputs: Reset, clk, and w) and one output (y), which is set to 1 following the "00111" patern.
