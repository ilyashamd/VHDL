# Multiple Patern Recognition Moore Model FSM

Problem: we which to implement a finite state machine (FSM) that recognizes two specific sequences of applied input symbols, namely three consecutive 1s or three consecutive 0s.
There is an input (w) and an output (y). Overlaping sequences are allowed.
