# Mealy Model FSM using VHDL

problem: Using enumerated data type; write the VHDL code of a Mealy model finite state machine to recognize when a serial stream of bits has the pattern "1010".
This machine has three (3) inputs: Reset, clk, and w) and one output (y), which is set to 1 following the "1010" patern.
